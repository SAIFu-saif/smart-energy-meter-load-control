# Smart Energy Meter with Load Control

This project monitors real-time power consumption and disconnects the load if the threshold is exceeded.

## Features
- Measures voltage, current, and calculates power
- Displays real-time data on LCD
- Automatically turns off load using relay

## Components
- Arduino Uno
- ACS712 Current Sensor
- Voltage Divider
- 16x2 LCD
- Relay Module

## How it works
The Arduino reads analog data from sensors, calculates power, and controls a relay based on power threshold.

## Folder Structure
- code/: Contains Arduino sketch
- images/: Circuit diagram (add later)
